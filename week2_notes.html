                    <h3>Javascript: Novice to Ninja</h3>
                    <h4>Chapter 2: Programming Basics</h4>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>                       
                            Don't forget how important comments are! Use lots of them! Also whitespace -- space between as well as nesting is helpful for readability of code.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            New-to-me syntax: Use <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong> in place of var. These are block-level variable declarations. "Const" is for variables whose values will not change; "let" is for variables that will change throughout the program.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This chapter answers last week's confusion about semicolons; interpreters use Automatic Semicolon Insertion, but it's still best practice to use semicolons at the end of a statement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Primitive Data Types: String, Symbol (new!), Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null. Everything else is an object (arrays, functions, object literals).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Methods described here: toUpperCase, toLowerCase, charAt, indexOf, lastIndexOf, concat, trim
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            New ES6 methods: includes(), startsWith(), endsWith(), repeat().
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Template literals are so cool! Use the backtick character ` as quotes around a string; this allows both types of quotes to be used, as well as allowing JavaScript code interpolation with ${ code here }
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            New primitive value: Symbols. Use the Symbol() function, with a description inside the parentheses. <strong>How are these used in practice?</strong> Need to research more.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Convert a string to a number with Number('7') -- it doesn't work if you try it on a true string like 'hello'. Convert a number to a string by using String(7) or 7..toString().
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Logical statements: !not, && and, || or. Exponents are notated with ** NOT a carat ^ for example, 2 to the power of 3 would be 2**3. Use Number.isNaN() in place of the former isNaN() to be more specific and reduce errors. Hard equality requires two compared values to be the same datatype: '1' === 1 > false
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Array: An ordered list of values, considered an Object. Create with square brackets, ex. const myArray = [];
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Call the value of an element in the array with its number, ex myArray[0]. You can also change the value with = just like changing a variable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Arrays are <strong>mutable</strong>; you can change their length, and if shorter than before, that will remove the extra entries.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Array Methods:
                            <ul>
                                <li>delete() - removes the value but replaces it with undefined</li>
                                <li>pop() - returns the last item of the array, but removes it from the array.</li>
                                <li>shift() - returns the first item of the array, but removes it.</li>
                                <li>push() - appends a new value to the end of the array.</li>
                                <li>unshift() - appends a new item at the beginning of the array. (why unshift? This is super non-intuitive)</li>
                                <li>slice(x,y) - copies out a chunk of the array from x to y (not including y) and creates a subarray to hold it</li>
                                <li>splice() - removes items from the array and replaces them with new ones.</li>
                                <li>reverse() - reverses the order of the array permanently.</li>
                                <li>sort() - sorts the array alphabetically, permanently. (use a callback to do this for numbers)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Sets: new in ES6. Create with = new Set();</li>
                        <li>Set Methods:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>add() - places a value into the set (if you try to add one that's already there, it will be ignored)</li>
                                <li>add([x,y,z]) - enters a list of values into the set with a quick array</li>
                                <li>new Set([x, y, z]) - creates a set and adds values into it.</li>
                                <li>size() - checks how many items are in the set and returns the number.</li>
                                <li>has() - checks for the value in the set and returns true/false.</li>
                                <li>delete() - removes the item from the set, returns true/false if it was successful or not.</li>
                                <li>clear() - removes all values from the set.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Convert a set into an array with method arrayName = [...setName] OR with arrayName = Array.from(setName). Use this to create a new array without any repeated values.</li>
                        <li>ES6 new for/of loop for arrays: for(const value of arrayName){do the stuff} -- this saves time not having to recalculate the length of the array vs the iterator in a for loop. Snazzy!</li>
                        <li>ES6 new item: Maps, ordered lists of key-value pairs. <strong>I need to study these a little more to understand how they work.</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Javascript: Novice to Ninja, Chapter 4: Functions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep code DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself!</li>
                        <li>Parameters are set when the function is defined; arguments are provided when invoking a function.</li>
                        <li>New in ES6: Arrow syntax. Shorter, doesn't need parentheses for single parameters, doesn't need a return statement if it's the only command in the function, doesn't bind "this" to the function (whatever that means, TBA later) Examples:
                            <ul>
                                <li>const square = x => x*x; (takes one variable, returns the answer to x*x)</li>
                                <li>const add = (x,y) => x + y; (takes two variables, adds them together)</li>
                                <li>const hello = () => alert('Hello World!'); (takes no parameters, requires empty parentheses)</li>
                                <li>const tax = (salary) => {<br />
                                    function stuff here;<br> />
                                    } (longer functions can still be placed in a block. This is not as useful as the little one-line arrow functions.)
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Q: What is hoisting used for?</strong> I'm not completely clear on how this works or where it's applicable, if you're using let and const instead of var.</li>
                        <li>Callbacks allow you to call a function with another function as an argument. (See our <a href="team4_week2.html">Week 2 team exercises</a> for an example)</li>
                        <li><strong>arguments</strong> is a built-in variable that allows you to access the function's parameters using array-index notation.</li>
                    </ul>
