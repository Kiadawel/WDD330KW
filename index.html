                    <p>This week's main objective was to set up a Git repository and portfolio for my work in this class (which you are now looking at). I also learned about LocalStorage and created a small example of how it's used.</p>

                    <p>This week was largely project-based, as we began Challenge #1 and worked on a more complex team project. We studied chapter 10, about debugging and testing options.</p>

                    <h3>CHALLENGE 1: To-Do List</h3>
                    <p>This solo project spanned two weeks. I built a small HTML frame, styled it with CSS, and used JavaScript modules to create a mobile-friendly web-based app that uses LocalStorage to allow the user to save, sort, check off, and delete items on a simple to-do list. Things I'm proud of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Modules and modular code are new to me, but I think I'm improving at streamlining the code and making it more portable (though still far from perfect)</li>
                        <li>Clicking back and forth was bugging me, so I learned how to bind an event to the "enter" key, which actually turned out to be really helpful when testing on my phone as well.</li>
                        <li>I designed a very simple check for user input that keeps the list from saving an empty field, subtly lighting up the text box and refocusing the cursor in the box if the button is clicked without entering a task first.</li>
                        <li>I think it's pretty. :)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Week 07</h3>
                    <p>This week we revisited the Hikes project team activity, and that's what I spent the most time on. We also studied other functions and AJAX from JS: Novice to Ninja.</p>
