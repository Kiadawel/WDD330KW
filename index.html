                    <h3>CHALLENGE 1: To-Do List</h3>
                    <p>This solo project spanned two weeks. I built a small HTML frame, styled it with CSS, and used JavaScript modules to create a mobile-friendly web-based app that uses LocalStorage to allow the user to save, sort, check off, and delete items on a simple to-do list. Things I'm proud of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Modules and modular code are new to me, but I think I'm improving at streamlining the code and making it more portable (though still far from perfect)</li>
                        <li>Clicking back and forth was bugging me, so I learned how to bind an event to the "enter" key, which actually turned out to be really helpful when testing on my phone as well.</li>
                        <li>I designed a very simple check for user input that keeps the list from saving an empty field, subtly lighting up the text box and refocusing the cursor in the box if the button is clicked without entering a task first.</li>
                        <li>I think it's pretty. :)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>CHALLENGE 2: PokeBreeder</h3>
                    <p>This solo project took roughly 4 weeks and well over 30 hours. It is a simple web app that allows you to choose favorite Pokemon, find the Pokemon they can breed with, and display what baby would result from a given pairing. Things I learned/things I like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I was originally making a bajillion API calls whenever I loaded a list of Pokemon in a particular Type group, if I hadn't saved it already. Needless to say, this took forever and probably would have gotten me in trouble with PokeAPI in the long run. I ended up using that set of calls/functions to create a JSON library of Pokemon entries with just the information I needed. Simple, but felt like a breakthrough!</li>
                        <li>I'm still getting used to how Promises are handled, but I'm getting more efficient at using async/await effectively.</li>
                        <li>I finally learned how to add event listeners that accept both touch and mouse click inputs. I think my solution may be clunky (rather like using a sledgehammer for a plastic Whack-a-Mole game) but it WORKS. :)</li>
                        <li>Because my knowledge of Pokemon games is *ahem* extensive, I was able to make exceptions for weird genders or breeding scenarios, such as Ditto not sharing an egg group with anyone/not being breedable with itself and yet showing up in everyone else's options. More exceptions: pokemon that cannot breed (such as Baby pokemon and legendaries), Nidoran male/female, etc. To the best of my knowledge, every breeding scenario should come up with the correct Baby result(s).</li>
                        <li>I utilized API, "local" JSON and LocalStorage for the app; API to pull information, LocalStorage to save a list of Pokemon that the user would like to try out in different scenarios.</li>
                        <li>I think it came out really cute, with dynamically-generated Type/gender colors and images. I paid a lot of attention to little style details (and exercised my SCSS skills in the process). If I were to spend more time sprucing it up, I would try to make the layout more responsive than it is now, with the content visible in different areas when the screen is wider.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Overall, I'm really pleased with what I was able to build, and I hope you like it! :)</p>

                    <p>This week's main objective was to set up a Git repository and portfolio for my work in this class (which you are now looking at). I also learned about LocalStorage and created a small example of how it's used.</p>

                    <h3>Week 08</h3>
                    <p>This week was a little bit of a breather; we focused on CSS transforms and animations, and a bit about using Canvas and SVGs. As a team, we practiced accessing an API with fetch and made a simple app to read from the Star Wars API.</p>

                    <h3>Week 09</h3>
                    <p>This week dealt with the BOM (Browser Object Model), the "window" object and its properties, and HTML5 APIs. As a team, we worked from a starter HTML/CSS code and added JS functionality to make sounds and move objects when certain keys are pressed.</p>

                    <h3>Week 10</h3>
                    <p>This week we began working on the Final Challenge (for me it'll be a Pokemon app) and took notes on Fetch and form validation. Our team activity was creating an earthquake-tracker app that checks your current location, accepts a date range and radius, and returns details about earthquakes in the area.</p>
