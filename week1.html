                    <h3>Doing Stuff With Web Things</h3>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>                       
                            <strong>Q: Is localStorage anything like cookies?</strong> Google says it's entirely based on the user's computer, not stored server-side, so it's different, but I'm having trouble wrapping my head around how exactly this data is saved and where.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Q: Are semicolons not required at the end of the line?</strong> I was taught they were essential unless it was a single line function. The code in this book doesn't have semicolons in it. A quick Google search infoms me that they aren't strictly required; they are added automatically by the browser where needed. However, they are still "best practice," so add them I shall.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Key-value pairs: "key" refers to the label or description, and "value" refers to the stuff it's holding. Key: "lamp." Value: "a bright thing that turns on and off." Etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Local storage object: If you pull an item with localStorage.getItem, you will pull up the VALUE of the key you used to call the key/value pair. If you want to display the KEY, you can use localStorage.key(i) -- where (i) stands for whatever variable calls the key/value pair. (see the function to list all stories below)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Story Editor</h3>
                    <p>This allows the user to write short stories/posts, save them, and show them. I used external JS and CSS for this instead of in-line. I did some extra research and wrote a function that will show a list of all the saved stories (so you don't have to remember them perfectly to find them again).</p>
                    <p>Story Name: <input id="name_input"></input></p>
                    <p>
                        <button onclick="loadStory()">Find and Edit It</button>
                        <button onclick="saveStory()">Save It</button>
                        <button onclick="displayStory()">Display It</button>
                    </p>
                    <p><textarea id="story_editor" placeholder="Write your totally awesome story!"></textarea></p>
